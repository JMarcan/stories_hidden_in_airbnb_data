# stories_hidden_in_airbnb_data
The project and its repository is in development

## Project description
I was curious what stories AirBnB data tells about those cities,
and whether those data can help landlords to increase their revenues and tentant to minimize their expenses.

I'm starting with interrest to find answer to the following questions:
- How looks the typical guest using AirBnB services? Is it foreigner or countryman? What is typical age?
- When the most people visit each city?
- What are the average prices per night?
- What is average realized revenue per month?   
- In which month is the most profitable to be landlord? In which month is best to do reconstructions?
- In which month is the most cost effective to visit the city as guest?

Data of the following cities will be analyzed and compared:
- Prague
- Munich
- Zurich
- San Francisco

Data for each city were gained from [insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

To exclude differences caused by variety in listing only the following accomodations will be considered:
   - city center, apartment, 2 guests, entire room, 1x bedroom, 1xbed, 1x private bath
